A standalone JavaScript web application for basic image manipulation. 

- Uses a single vanilla JavaScript script file `app.js`, single HTML file `index.html`, and single CSS file `styles.css`.
- No external libraries or third party plug-ins.
- Utilizes features found in most modern browsers. 
- Runs completely locally on your device using your web browser.
- Does not upload any of your files to the internet, so none of your files ever leave your computer.
